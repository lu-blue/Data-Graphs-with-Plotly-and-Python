200,In an age when the study of antiquity attracted the most energetic minds when the ashes of Pompeii were sifted for the playthings of Roman life; when parchments were made to disclose by chemical means the erased thoughts of Grecian thinkers; when the tombs of Egypt were ransacked for their sacred contents and the palaces of Babylon and Nineveh forced to surrender the clay diaries of Nebuchadnezzar; when everything in fact that seemed to contain a vestige of the early life of man was anxiously searched for and carefully preserved in our libraries and museums— language which in itself carries us back far beyond the cuneiform literature of Assyria and Babylonia and the hieroglyphic documents of Egypt; which connects ourselves through an unbroken chain of speech with the very ancestors of our race and still draws its life from the first utterances of the human mind— language the living and speaking witness of the whole history of our race was never cross-examined by the student of history was never made to disclose its secrets until questioned and so to say brought back to itself within the last fifty years by the genius of a Humboldt Bopp Grimm Bunsen and others,1,1
 144,If you consider that whatever view we take of the origin and dispersion of language nothing new has ever been added to the substance of language that all its changes have been changes of form that no new root or radical has ever been invented by later generations as little as one single element has ever been added to the material world in which we live; if you bear in mind that in one sense and in a very just sense we may be said to handle the very words which issued from the mouth of the son of God when he gave names to “all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field” you will see I believe that the science of language has claims on your attention such as few sciences can rival or excel,1,2
 118,Man had studied every part of nature the mineral treasures in the bowels of the earth the flowers of each season the animals of every continent the laws of storms and the movements of the heavenly bodies; he had analyzed every substance dissected every organism he knew every bone and muscle every nerve and fibre of his own body to the ultimate elements which compose his flesh and blood; he had meditated on the nature of his soul on the laws of his mind and tried to penetrate into the last causes of all being— and yet language without the aid of which not even the first step in this glorious career could have been made remained unnoticed,1,3
 116,It has absorbed the thoughts of men who after a long life spent in collecting observing and analyzing have brought to its solution qualifications unrivalled in any previous age; and if we may judge from the greater warmth displayed in discussions ordinarily conducted with the calmness of judges and not with the passion of pleaders it might seem after all as if the great problems of our being of the true nobility of our blood of our descent from heaven or earth though unconnected with anything that is commonly called practical have still retained a charm of their own— a charm that will never lose its power on the mind and on the heart of man,1,4
 93,The dimensions of the science of language are so vast that it is impossible in a course of nine lectures to give more than a very general survey of it; and as one of the greatest charms of this science consists in the minuteness of the analysis by which each language each dialect each word each grammatical form is tested I felt that it was almost impossible to do full justice to my subject or to place the achievements of those who founded and fostered the science of language in their true light,1,5
 90,The astronomer retains these and many other names; he still speaks of the pole of heaven of wandering and fixed stars but he is apt to forget that these terms were not the result of scientific observation and classification but were borrowed from the language of those who themselves were wanderers on the sea or in the desert and to whom the fixed stars were in full reality what their name implies stars driven in and fixed by which they might hold fast on the deep as by heavenly anchors,1,6
 85,If with all these difficulties and drawbacks I do not shrink from opening to-day this course of lectures on mere words on nouns and verbs and particles— if I venture to address an audience accustomed to listen in this place to the wonderful tales of the natural historian the chemist and geologist and wont to see the novel results of inductive reasoning invested by native eloquence with all the charms of poetry and romance— it is because though mistrusting myself I cannot mistrust my subject,1,7
 85,If therefore the science of language gives us an insight into that which by common consent distinguishes man from all other living beings; if it establishes a frontier between man and the brute which can never be removed it would seem to possess at the present moment peculiar claims on the attention of all who while watching with sincere admiration the progress of comparative physiology yet consider it their duty to enter their manly protest against a revival of the shallow theories of Lord Monboddo,1,8
 82,I felt convinced that the researches into the history of languages and into the nature of human speech which have been carried on for the last fifty years in England France and Germany deserved a larger share of public sympathy than they had hitherto received; and it seemed to me as far as I could judge that the discoveries in this newly-opened mine of scientific inquiry were not inferior whether in novelty or importance to the most brilliant discoveries of our age,1,9
 79,Now although it may seem as if in the present high state of our society students were enabled to devote their time to the investigation of the facts and laws of nature or to the contemplation of the mysteries of the world of thought without any side-glance at the practical result of their labors no science and no art have long prospered and flourished among us unless they were in some way subservient to the practical interests of society,1,10
99,The word “house” is not a linguistic fact if by it is meant merely the acoustic effect produced on the ear by its constituent consonants and vowels pronounced in a certain order; nor the motor processes and tactile feelings which make up the articulation of the word; nor the visual perception on the part of the hearer of this articulation; nor the visual perception of the word “house” on the written or printed page; nor the motor processes and tactile feelings which enter into the writing of the word; nor the memory of any or all of these experiences,2,1
 88,This can only mean that the sounds of speech are localized in the auditory tract of the brain or in some circumscribed portion of it precisely as other classes of sounds are localized; and that the motor processes involved in speech (such as the movements of the glottal cords in the larynx the movements of the tongue required to pronounce the vowels lip movements required to articulate certain consonants and numerous others) are localized in the motor tract precisely as are all other impulses to special motor activities,2,2
 71,The auditory centers alone may be excited; or the impulse to linguistic expression may be communicated as well to the motor nerves that communicate with the organs of speech but be inhibited either in the muscles of these organs or at some point in the motor nerves themselves; or possibly the auditory centers may be only slightly if at all affected the speech process manifesting itself directly in the motor sphere,2,3
 68,The auditory symbolism may be replaced point for point by a motor or by a visual symbolism (many people can read for instance in a purely visual sense that is without the intermediating link of an inner flow of the auditory images that correspond to the printed or written words) or by still other more subtle and elusive types of transfer that are not so easy to define,2,4
 67,Naturally the particular points or clusters of points of localization in the several tracts that refer to any element of language are connected in the brain by paths of association so that the outward or psycho-physical aspect of language is of a vast network of associated localizations in the brain and lower nervous tracts the auditory localizations being without doubt the most fundamental of all for speech,2,5
 64,It is even conceivable if not exactly likely that certain operators may have learned to think directly so far as the purely conscious part of the process of thought is concerned in terms of the tick-auditory symbolism or if they happen to have a strong natural bent toward motor symbolism in terms of the correlated tactile-motor symbolism developed in the sending of telegraphic messages,2,6
 63,As such they may be considered an integral portion of speech in the properly cultural sense of the term being no more identical with the instinctive cries themselves than such words as “cuckoo” and “kill-deer” are identical with the cries of the birds they denote or than Rossini’s treatment of a storm in the overture to “William Tell” is in fact a storm,2,7
 59,Were the symbol “house”— whether an auditory motor or visual experience or image— attached but to the single image of a particular house once seen it might perhaps by an indulgent criticism be termed an element of speech yet it is obvious at the outset that speech so constituted would have little or no value for purposes of communication,2,8
 58,Some of these systems are one-to-one equivalences of the normal system of speech; others like military gesture-symbolism or the gesture language of the Plains Indians of North America (understood by tribes of mutually unintelligible forms of speech) are imperfect transfers limiting themselves to the rendering of such grosser speech elements as are an imperative minimum under difficult circumstances,2,9
 57,In a very real sense the normal human being is predestined to walk not because his elders will assist him to learn the art but because his organism is prepared from birth or even from the moment of conception to take on all those expenditures of nervous energy and all those muscular adaptations that result in walking,2,10
